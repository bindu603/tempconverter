### *HTML Structure*
- *<head> Section:*
  - Includes the title of the page ("Temperature Converter") and a <style> block for internal CSS.
  
- *<body> Section:*
  - *Background Image*: The page has a background image specified by the background-image property in the body selector. This image is sourced from a local file path ("E:\v2havadurumu_1670053019.jpg").
  - *Converter Container*: A div with the class "converter" houses the input fields and button. This container has a semi-transparent white background with rounded corners and a slight shadow, making it visually appealing and easy to read against the background.
  - *Input and Selection Elements*: 
    - A text input for the temperature value.
    - A dropdown (<select>) to choose between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
    - A button that triggers the conversion process when clicked.
  - *Result Display*: The conversion result is shown in a <p> element with the id "result."

### *CSS Styling*
- The body is styled to center the converter on the page both horizontally and vertically.
- The converter is styled with a semi-transparent white background, padding, rounded corners, and a shadow to enhance readability.
- The inputs, select dropdown, and button are styled with padding and border-radius for a consistent look.

### *JavaScript Functionality*
- *Function convertTemperature:*
  - Fetches the input temperature value and selected unit from the DOM.
  - Validates the input to ensure it's a numeric value.
  - Depending on the selected unit, it converts the temperature to the appropriate unit using basic formulas:
    - *Celsius to Fahrenheit*: (temperature * 9/5) + 32
    - *Fahrenheit to Celsius*: (temperature - 32) * 5/9
    - *Celsius to Kelvin*: temperature + 273.15
  - The result is then displayed in the "result" paragraph with a message indicating the conversion.

### *Limitations and Improvements*
- *Limited Conversion Options*: Currently, the conversion logic is somewhat limited because it doesn't allow conversions between all units (e.g., Fahrenheit to Kelvin, etc.). 
- *User Experience*: Adding additional conversion options or input validation could improve the user experience.
- *Responsive Design*: While the page is centered, additional CSS media queries could be added to make the converter more responsive on different screen sizes.
